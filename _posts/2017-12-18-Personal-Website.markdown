This was my first experience at front-end development and I found it to be a very rewarding experience. It was a large change from the type of programming I had become used to from classes, which was either Java or C/C++ and much more low level. I found it an interesting challenge to use the constantly and rapidly developing web frameworks, with limited documentation and examples, but found it rewarding and highly leveraged.
