### Hey, I'm Thomas Harmon ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack software engineer currently located in Boston, MA.

My combined major in Computer Engineering and Computer Science has made me a 
jack-of-all trades and a master at quickly learning new skills. My specialties 
are in back-end development, system design and architecture, and systems
programming. I'm especially interested in all things Rust (the programming
language!) because of its focus on safety, speed, and concurrency.
