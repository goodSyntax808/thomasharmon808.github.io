My combined major in Computer Engineering and Computer Science has made me a jack-of-all trades and a master at quickly learning new skills. My specialties are in back-end development, system design and architecture, and systems programming. I&amp;rsquo;m especially interested in all things Rust (the programming language!) because of its focus on safety, speed, and concurrency.</description></item></channel></rss>
