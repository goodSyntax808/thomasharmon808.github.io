My specialities are in back-end development, system design, and machine learning. Feel free to connect with me through any of the following:"},"about":{"content":"I'm a fifth year student at Northeastern University, currently applying for full time jobs starting in May of 2020. At Northeastern I found a passion for back-end software engineering and have gained invaluable real-world experience during numerous internships. I especially enjoy machine learning and working with modern technology stacks. I was originally born and raised in Hawaii, and during my co-ops I have found that it has given me a unique insight and perspective. One day I hope to retire there so I can focus on my passions of surfing and glassblowing.","skills":["C/C++","Java","JavaScript","Python","HTML/CSS","React","NodeJS","SQL","Git","TensorFlow","Spring","JUnit","Jest"],"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":0.7503828483920367,"src":"/static/b0cda267878caa22c201c616b62a2ee2/340f0/headshot.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b0cda267878caa22c201c616b62a2ee2/7fd17/headshot.jpg 175w,\n/static/b0cda267878caa22c201c616b62a2ee2/804d2/headshot.jpg 350w,\n/static/b0cda267878caa22c201c616b62a2ee2/340f0/headshot.jpg 490w","srcWebp":"/static/b0cda267878caa22c201c616b62a2ee2/0b132/headshot.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/b0cda267878caa22c201c616b62a2ee2/61503/headshot.webp 175w,\n/static/b0cda267878caa22c201c616b62a2ee2/850cb/headshot.webp 350w,\n/static/b0cda267878caa22c201c616b62a2ee2/0b132/headshot.webp 490w","sizes":"(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px"}}}},"experience":{"jobs":[{"company":"PowerAdvocate","title":"Software Engineer","url":"https://w3.poweradvocate.com","range":"July 2019 - Dec. 2019","details":["Full stack development of a SaaS application with React, NodeJS, and Java.","Orchestrated redesign of a J2EE monolithic web application into a Micro-Service Oriented Architecture and monetizable API.","Researched, implemented, and presented database optimizations for increasing performance of customer features by 5-30x.","Collaborated with other developers by pair programming.
