My specialities are in back-end development, system design, and machine learning. Feel free to connect with me through any of the following:"},"about":{"content":"I'm a fifth year student at Northeastern University, currently applying for full time jobs starting in May of 2020. At Northeastern I found a passion for back-end software engineering and have gained invaluable real-world experience during numerous internships. I especially enjoy machine learning and working with modern technology stacks. I was originally born and raised in Hawaii, and during my co-ops I have found that it has given me a unique insight and perspective. One day I hope to retire there so I can focus on my passions of surfing and glassblowing.","skills":["Java","JavaScript","Kotlin","Rust","C/C++","Python","SQL","HTML/CSS","React","Elasticsearch","AWS","Git","TensorFlow","JUnit","Jest"],"avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":0.7503828483920367,"src":"/static/b0cda267878caa22c201c616b62a2ee2/340f0/headshot.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b0cda267878caa22c201c616b62a2ee2/7fd17/headshot.jpg 175w,\n/static/b0cda267878caa22c201c616b62a2ee2/804d2/headshot.jpg 350w,\n/static/b0cda267878caa22c201c616b62a2ee2/340f0/headshot.jpg 490w","srcWebp":"/static/b0cda267878caa22c201c616b62a2ee2/0b132/headshot.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/b0cda267878caa22c201c616b62a2ee2/61503/headshot.webp 175w,\n/static/b0cda267878caa22c201c616b62a2ee2/850cb/headshot.webp 350w,\n/static/b0cda267878caa22c201c616b62a2ee2/0b132/headshot.webp 490w","sizes":"(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px"}}}},"experience":{"jobs":[{"company":"PowerAdvocate","title":"Software Engineer","url":"https://w3.poweradvocate.com","range":"July 2019 - Dec. 2019","details":["Researched, implemented, and presented database optimizations that increased performance for clients by 5-30x","Contributed to redesign of a monolithic web application into a microservice-oriented architecture and monetizable API.","Developed NodeJS microservice allowing analysts to search by using Elasticsearch, increasing searching accuracy.","Practiced Agile Development under a Continuous Flow framework, collaborating with other developers by pair programming.","Created unit and integration tests using Jest to ensure reliability and resiliency of software."]},{"company":"RIVeR Labs","title":"Undergraduate Researcher","url":"http://robot.neu.edu","range":"Jan. 2018 - July 2018","details":["Developed facial recognition and person following packages for the Toyota HSR in a RoboCup@Home competition.","Placed 4th internationally in a RoboCup@Home competition in Montreal, Canada as part of a team of 6 researchers.","Researched, built, and tested a prototype autonomous navigation system based on optical flow."]},{"company":"Draper","title":"Advanced Concepts Engineer","url":"https://www.draper.com","range":"Jan. 2017 - July 2017","details":["Created a Java application to translate system engineering models between OpenMETA and sysML.","Modernized existing file system approach by utilizing a graph database as a single source of truth for system engineering models.","Integrated database and Java app into continuous integration workflow for engineering models, greatly improving efficiency.","Utilized ANSYS Electronic Desktop to model operational effects of varying RF wavelengths on a PCB based on trace dimensions."]}]},"projects":{"projects":[{"name":"GShell - Rust","url":"https://github.com/thomasharmon808/gshell","description":"A redevelopment of the original shell project, but in Rust in order to learn a new programming language that I found very cool.
